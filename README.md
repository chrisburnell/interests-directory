# Interests Directory

## What is an "/interests page"?

Similar to the [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about) and [About Ideas Now](https://nownownow.com/about) initiatives, an `/interests` page is a place on your website where you can write about whatever you’re passionate about!

The purpose of this project is to help folks across the web find people with similar interests, learn more about the people behind your favourite websites, and find new rabbit holes to dive into!

## Add your /interests page

If you have an account on GitHub, please follow the steps below.

If not, feel free to [reach out to me](https://chrisburnell.com/about/#contact) and let me know what name you would like to have appear in the list and the <abbr title="uniform resource locator">URL</abbr> of your `/interests` page.

1. Create a new file in the _people directory in the GitHub repository by clicking "Add file" → "Create new file": https://github.com/chrisburnell/interests-directory/tree/main/_people
2. Add the following as the contents of the file, replacing the name and page values with your own:
```
---
name: Jane Doe
page: https://example.com/interests
---
```
3. Save the file as a Markdown file with the `.md` file extension.
4. GitHub will prompt you to fork the repository under your own user so that a Pull Request can be made.
5. I (Chris Burnell) will review submissions as quickly as I am able, and when your Pull Request is merged, your website will appear in the list above!

If you want an example of how this file looks with real user data, you can look at the source code of any of the files there, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/chrisburnell/interests-directory/blob/main/_people/chrisburnell.md).
